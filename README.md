# Glcca
Glcca stands for Golang Compiler Compiler again. It's a run little project to first, build a lexer generator in Golang. After that, our goal is to move onto parsing.

## Dependencies:

Goop, your friendly package manager. You can get Goop [right here](https://github.com/nitrous-io/goop).
After installing Goop, from inside your project directory run `goop install`. This will grab all of the other deps and install them in a `.vendor` directory.
